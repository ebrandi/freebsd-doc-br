    <para>O &os; é um sistema operacional baseado no 4.4BSD-Lite e 
	está disponível para computadores de arquitetura &intel; 
	(x86 ou &itanium;) AMD64 e &sun; &ultrasparc;. Versões 
	portadas para outras arquiteturas também estão em 
	desenvolvimento. Você pode ler um pouco mais sobre este 
	assunto nas sessões sobre a <link linkend="history">história</link> 
	e sobre as <link linkend="relnotes">versões mais atuais</link> 
	do &os;. Se despertar em você o interesse em contribuir de

      <title>O Que o &os; Pode Fazer?</title>

      <para>O &os; apresenta funcionalidades notáveis. Algumas

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <indexterm><primary>preemptive multitasking</primary></indexterm>

	  <para><emphasis>Multitarefa Preemptiva</emphasis> com ajuste

	  <para><emphasis>Ambientes Multiusuário</emphasis> permitem 
	    que diversos usuários façam uso do &os; simultaneamente 
	    para executar uma variedade de tarefas. Isso significa 
	    que se existirem periféricos como uma impressora ou um 
	    drive de fita magnética corretamente compartilhados para 
	    todos os usuários no sistema ou na rede e seus recursos 
	    possam ser individualmente separados (por usuário ou grupo), 
	    será garantida a limitação do recurso utilizado por cada 
	    usuário, protejendo-o dos demais.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <indexterm><primary>TCP/IP networking</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>Robusta implementação da pilha <emphasis>TCP/IP</emphasis> 
	    com suporte para diversos protocolos padronizados como 
	    SCTP, DNS, DHCP, NFS, NIS, PPP, SLIP, IPsec e <emphasis>IPv6</emphasis>. 
	    Isso significa que seu sistema &os; pode interoperar 
	    tranquilamente com outros sistemas ou funcionar como um 
	    servidor para prover serviços numa rede corporativa, 
	    fornecendo serviços vitais como NFS (compartilhamento 
	    remoto de arquivos) e correio eletrônico ou colocando sua 
	    organização na Internet por meio de um sítio WWW, um servidor 
	    FTP ou, ainda, fazendo roteamento de pacotes/dados ou 
	    servindo como firewall (filtro) para seus serviços.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <indexterm><primary>memory protection</primary></indexterm>

	  <para>A <emphasis>Proteção em Áreas de Memória</emphasis>

      <para>O &os; é baseado no 4.4BSD-Lite criado pelo Grupo de 
	Pesquisa de Sistemas Computacionais (<literal>Computer 
	Systems Research Group - CSRG</literal>) na Universidade da 
	Califórnia de Berkeley e carrega a tradição de um distinto 
	esquema de desenvolvimento dos sistemas BSD de Berkeley. 
	Além do belo trabalho realizado pelo CSRG, o Projeto &os; 
	passou por muitas centenas de horas sofrendo ajustes a fim de 
	melhorar sua performance e confiabilidade para funcionar em 
	situações em que se exige muita carga do sistema. Enquanto 
	diversos gigantes no mundo comercial de sistemas operacionais 
	para PC estão se esforçando para prover tais funcionalidades, 
	o &os; lhe oferece elas <emphasis>agora</emphasis>!</para>

      <para>As aplicações nas quais o &os; pode ser encaixado 
	limitam-se apenas a sua imaginação. Desde uma estação de 
	trabalho para desenvolvimento de código até um sistema para 
	automação industrial; de um sistema para controle de 
	inventário até um sistema remoto de correção de azimute (ângulo) 
	para uma antena de satélite. Se é possível de ser feito por 
	um sistema comercial de linhagem &unix;, pode, certamente, 
	ser feito com &os;! O &os; também se beneficia significativamente 
	de outras aplicações desenvolvidas por centros de pesquisa e 
	universidades ao redor do mundo, geralmente a um baixo 
	(ou nenhum) custo. Aplicações comerciais que surgem aos montes 
	a cada dia também podem ser executadas no &os;.</para>

      <para>Pelo fato do código fonte do &os; estar disponível, o 
	sistema pode ser customizado para uma infinidade de 
	funcionalidades ou projetos especiais até mesmo sem que 
	fiquemos sabendo de sua existência. De maneira geral, isso 
	não é possível de ser feito utilizando um outro sistema 
	operacional licenciado e vendido comercialmente. Aqui estão

      <indexterm>
	<primary>FreeBSD Project</primary>
	<secondary>history</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The &os;&nbsp;Project had its genesis in the early part of 1993,
	partially as an outgrowth of the <quote>Unofficial 386BSD
	Patchkit</quote> by the patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate
	Williams, Rod Grimes and myself.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>386BSD</primary></indexterm>
      <para>Our original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot of
	386BSD in order to fix a number of problems with it that the
	patchkit mechanism just was not capable of solving.  Some of you
	may remember the early working title for the project being
	<quote>386BSD 0.5</quote> or <quote>386BSD Interim</quote> in
	reference to that fact.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Jolitz, Bill</primary></indexterm>
      <para>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been up
	to that point suffering rather severely from almost a year's worth
	of neglect.  As the patchkit swelled ever more uncomfortably with
	each passing day, we were in unanimous agreement that something
	had to be done and decided to assist Bill by providing
	this interim <quote>cleanup</quote> snapshot.  Those plans came to
	a rude halt when Bill Jolitz suddenly decided to withdraw his
	sanction from the project without any clear indication of what
	would be done instead.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Greenman, David</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Walnut Creek CDROM</primary></indexterm>
      <para>It did not take us long to decide that the goal remained
	worthwhile, even without Bill's support, and so we adopted the
	name <quote>&os;</quote>, coined by David Greenman.  Our initial
	objectives were set after consulting with the system's current
	users and, once it became clear that the project was on the road
	to perhaps even becoming a reality, I contacted Walnut Creek CDROM
	with an eye toward improving &os;'s distribution channels for
	those many unfortunates without easy access to the Internet.
	Walnut Creek CDROM not only supported the idea of distributing
	&os; on CD but also went so far as to provide the project with a
	machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  Without Walnut
	Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in what was, at
	the time, a completely unknown project, it is quite unlikely that
	&os; would have gotten as far, as fast, as it has today.</para>

      <para>The first CD-ROM (and general net-wide) distribution was
	&os;&nbsp;1.0, released in December of 1993.  This was based on the
	4.3BSD-Lite (<quote>Net/2</quote>) tape from U.C. Berkeley, with
	many components also provided by 386BSD and the Free Software
	Foundation.  It was a fairly reasonable success for a first
	offering, and we followed it with the highly successful &os;
	1.1 release in May of 1994.</para>

      <para>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds formed
	on the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled their
	long-running lawsuit over the legal status of the Berkeley Net/2
	tape.  A condition of that settlement was U.C. Berkeley's
	concession that large parts of Net/2 were <quote>encumbered</quote>
	code and the property of Novell, who had in turn acquired it from
	AT&amp;T some time previously.  What Berkeley got in return was
	Novell's <quote>blessing</quote> that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when
	it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered and all
	existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to switch.  This
	included &os;, and the project was given until the end of July
	1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based product.  Under the
	terms of that agreement, the project was allowed one last release
	before the deadline, that release being &os;&nbsp;1.1.5.1.</para>

      <para>&os; then set about the arduous task of literally
	re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather incomplete
	set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits.  The <quote>Lite</quote> releases were
	light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had removed large chunks of
	code required for actually constructing a bootable running system
	(due to various legal requirements) and the fact that the Intel
	port of 4.4 was highly incomplete.  It took the project until
	November of 1994 to make this transition, at which point it
	released &os;&nbsp;2.0 to the net and on CD-ROM (in late December).
	Despite being still more than a little rough around the edges,
	the release was a significant success and was followed by the
	more robust and easier to install &os;&nbsp;2.0.5 release in June of
	1995.</para>

      <para>We released &os;&nbsp;2.1.5 in August of 1996, and it appeared
	to be popular enough among the ISP and commercial communities that
	another release along the 2.1-STABLE branch was merited.  This was
	&os;&nbsp;2.1.7.1, released in February 1997 and capping the end of
	mainstream development on 2.1-STABLE.  Now in maintenance mode,
	only security enhancements and other critical bug fixes will be
	done on this branch (RELENG_2_1_0).</para>

      <para>&os;&nbsp;2.2 was branched from the development mainline
	(<quote>-CURRENT</quote>) in November 1996 as the RELENG_2_2
	branch, and the first full release (2.2.1) was released in April
	1997.  Further releases along the 2.2 branch were done in the
	summer and fall of '97, the last of which (2.2.8) appeared in
	November 1998.  The first official 3.0 release appeared in
	October 1998 and spelled the beginning of the end for the 2.2
	branch.</para>

      <para>The tree branched again on Jan 20, 1999, leading to the
	4.0-CURRENT and 3.X-STABLE branches.  From 3.X-STABLE, 3.1 was
	released on February 15, 1999, 3.2 on May 15, 1999, 3.3 on
	September 16, 1999, 3.4 on December 20, 1999, and 3.5 on
	June 24, 2000, which was followed a few days later by a minor
	point release update to 3.5.1, to incorporate some last-minute
	security fixes to Kerberos.  This will be the final release in the
	3.X branch.</para>

      <para>There was another branch on March 13, 2000, which saw the
	emergence of the 4.X-STABLE branch.  There have been several releases
	from it so far: 4.0-RELEASE was introduced in March 2000, and
	the last 4.11-RELEASE came out in January 2005.</para>

      <para>The long-awaited 5.0-RELEASE was announced on January 19,
	2003.  The culmination of nearly three years of work, this
	release started &os; on the path of advanced multiprocessor
	and application thread support and introduced support for the
	&ultrasparc; and <literal>ia64</literal> platforms.  This release
	was followed by 5.1 in June of 2003.  The last 5.X release from the
	-CURRENT branch was 5.2.1-RELEASE, introduced in February 2004.</para>

      <para>The RELENG_5 branch, created in August 2004, was followed by
	5.3-RELEASE, which marked the beginning of the 5-STABLE branch
	releases.  The most recent 5.5-RELEASE release came out in May 2006.
	There will be no additional releases from the RELENG_5 branch.</para>

      <para>The tree was branched again in July 2005, this time for RELENG_6.
	6.0-RELEASE, the first release of the 6.X branch, was released in
	November 2005.  The most recent 6.4-RELEASE came out in
	November 2008.  There will be no additional releases from the
	RELENG_6 branch.  This branch is the last branch to support the
	Alpha architecture.</para>

      <para>The RELENG_7 branch was created in October 2007.  The first
	release of this branch was 7.0-RELEASE, which came
	out in February 2008.  The most recent 7.4-RELEASE came out
	in February 2011.  There will be no additional releases from the
	RELENG_7 branch.</para>

      <para>The tree was branched again in August 2009, this time for
	RELENG_8.  8.0-RELEASE, the first release of the 8.X branch, was
	released in November 2009.  The most recent
	&rel2.current;-RELEASE came out in &rel2.current.date;.  There will
	be additional releases from the RELENG_8 branch.</para>

      <para>The RELENG_9 branch was created in September 2011.  The first
	release of this branch was &rel.current;-RELEASE, which came
	out in &rel.current.date;.  There will be additional releases
	from the RELENG_9 branch.</para>

      <para>For now, long-term development projects continue to take place
	in the 10.X-CURRENT (trunk) branch, and SNAPshot releases of 10.X on
	CD-ROM (and, of course, on the net) are continually made available
	from <ulink
	  url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/">the snapshot
	  server</ulink> as work progresses.</para>

      <para>The goals of the &os;&nbsp;Project are to provide software that
	may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.  Many of
	us have a significant investment in the code (and project) and
	would certainly not mind a little financial compensation now and
	then, but we are definitely not prepared to insist on it.  We
	believe that our first and foremost <quote>mission</quote> is to
	provide code to any and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so
	that the code gets the widest possible use and provides the widest
	possible benefit.  This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental
	goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
	support.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>FreeBSD Project</primary>
	<secondary>development model</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The development of &os; is a very open and flexible
	process, being literally built from the contributions
	of hundreds of people around the world, as can be seen from
	our <ulink
	  url="&url.articles.contributors;/article.html">list of
	  contributors</ulink>.  &os;'s development infrastructure allow
	these hundreds of developers to collaborate over the Internet.
	We are constantly on the lookout for
	new developers and ideas, and those interested in becoming
	more closely involved with the project need simply contact us
	at the &a.hackers;.  The &a.announce; is also available to
	those wishing to make other &os; users aware of major areas
	of work.</para>

      <para>Useful things to know about the &os;&nbsp;Project and its
	development process, whether working independently or in close
	cooperation:</para>

	    <para>For several years, the central source tree for &os;
	      was maintained by
	      <ulink url="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</ulink>
	      (Concurrent Versions System), a freely available source code
	      control tool that comes bundled with &os;.  In June 2008, the
	      Project switched to using <ulink
		url="http://subversion.tigris.org">SVN</ulink> (Subversion).
	      The switch was deemed necessary, as the technical limitations
	      imposed by <application>CVS</application> were becoming obvious
	      due to the rapid expansion of the source tree and the amount
	      of history already stored.  The Documentation Project
	      and Ports Collection repositories also moved from
	      <application>CVS</application> to
	      <application>SVN</application> in May 2012 and July
	      2012, respectively.</para>

	    <para>While the <literal>src/</literal> and
	      <literal>ports/</literal> repositories now use
	      <application>SVN</application>, client side tools like
	      <application>csup</application> that depend on the older
	      <application>CVS</application> infrastructure, continue to
	      work normally &mdash; changes in the
	      <application>SVN</application> repository are backported to
	      <application>CVS</application> for this purpose.
	      Unlike <literal>src/</literal> and
	      <literal>ports/</literal>,
	      the documentation <application>SVN</application>
	      repository is not backported to

	    <para>The primary <application>CVS</application>
	      <ulink

	      resides on a machine in Santa Clara CA, USA
	      from where it is replicated to numerous mirror machines
	      throughout the world.  The <application>SVN</application> tree,
	      which contains the <link linkend="current">-CURRENT</link> and

	      comes from the source control <command>commit</command>
	      command, which is used to bring new changes into the
	      repository).  The best way of making submissions for review
	      by the committers list is to use the &man.send-pr.1;

	  <term>The FreeBSD core team<anchor id="development-core"/></term>

	  <listitem>
	    <indexterm><primary>core team</primary></indexterm>

	    <para>The <firstterm>&os; core team</firstterm>
	      would be equivalent to the board of directors if the
	      &os;&nbsp;Project were a company.  The primary task of the core
	      team is to make sure the project, as a whole, is in good shape
	      and is heading in the right directions.  Inviting dedicated
	      and responsible developers to join our group of committers
	      is one of the functions of the core team, as is the
	      recruitment of new core team members as others move on.
	      The current core team was elected from a pool of committer
	      candidates in July 2012.  Elections are held
	      every 2 years.</para>

	    <para>Some core team members also have specific areas of
	      responsibility, meaning that they are committed to
	      ensuring that some large portion of the system works as
	      advertised.  For a complete list of &os; developers
	      and their areas of responsibility, please see the <ulink

		List</ulink></para>

	    <note>
	      <para>Most members of the core team are volunteers when it
		comes to &os; development and do not benefit from the
		project financially, so <quote>commitment</quote> should
		also not be misconstrued as meaning <quote>guaranteed
		support.</quote>  The <quote>board of directors</quote>
		analogy above is not very accurate, and it may be
		more suitable to say that these are the people who gave up
		their lives in favor of &os; against their better

	    <para>Last, but definitely not least, the largest group of
	      developers are the users themselves who provide feedback and
	      bug fixes to us on an almost constant basis.  The primary
	      way of keeping in touch with &os;'s more non-centralized
	      development is to subscribe to the &a.hackers; where such
	      things are discussed.  See <xref linkend="eresources"/> for
	      more information about the various &os; mailing lists.</para>

	    <para><citetitle><ulink

	      the project; for a more complete list of things that need

      <para>In summary, our development model is organized as a loose set
	of concentric circles.  The centralized model is designed for the
	convenience of the <emphasis>users</emphasis> of &os;, who are
	provided with an easy way of tracking one central code
	base, not to keep potential contributors out! Our desire is to
	present a stable operating system with a large set of coherent
	<link linkend="ports">application programs</link> that the users
	can easily install and use &mdash; this model works very well in
	accomplishing that.</para>

      <para>All we ask of those who would join us as &os; developers is
	some of the same dedication its current people have to its
	continued success!</para>

	&pentium;&nbsp;II,
	&pentium;&nbsp;III,
	&pentium;&nbsp;4 (or compatible),
	&xeon;,
	and Sun &ultrasparc; based computer
	systems.  It is based primarily on software from U.C. Berkeley's
	CSRG group, with some enhancements from NetBSD, OpenBSD, 386BSD, and
	the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <para>Since our release of &os;&nbsp;2.0 in late 1994, the performance,
	feature set, and stability of &os; has improved dramatically.
	<!-- XXX is the rest of this paragraph still true ? -->
	The largest change is a revamped virtual memory system with a merged
	VM/file buffer cache that not only increases performance, but also
	reduces &os;'s memory footprint, making a 5&nbsp;MB configuration a
	more acceptable minimum.  Other enhancements include full NIS client
	and server support, transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP,
	integrated DHCP support, an improved SCSI subsystem, ISDN support,
	support for ATM, FDDI, Fast and Gigabit Ethernet (1000&nbsp;Mbit)
	adapters, improved support for the latest Adaptec controllers, and
	many thousands of bug fixes.</para>

      <para>In addition to the base distributions, &os; offers a
	ported software collection with thousands of commonly
	sought-after programs.  At the time of this printing, there
	were over &os.numports; ports!  The list of ports ranges from
	http (WWW) servers, to games, languages, editors, and almost
	everything in between.  The entire Ports Collection requires
	approximately &ports.size; of storage, all ports being expressed as
	<quote>deltas</quote> to their original sources.  This makes
	it much easier for us to update ports, and greatly reduces the
	disk space demands made by the older 1.0 Ports Collection.  To
	compile a port, you simply change to the directory of the
	program you wish to install, type <command>make install</command>,
	and let the system do the rest.  The full
	original distribution for each port you build is retrieved
	dynamically off the CD-ROM or a local FTP site, so you need
	only enough disk space to build the ports you want.  Almost
	every port is also provided as a pre-compiled
	<quote>package</quote>, which can be installed with a simple
	command (<command>pkg_add</command>) by those who do not wish
	to compile their own ports from source.  More information on
	packages and ports can be found in <xref linkend="ports"/>.</para>

      <para>All recent &os; versions provide an option in the installer
	(either &man.sysinstall.8; or &man.bsdinstall.8;) to install
	additional documentation under <filename
	  class="directory">/usr/local/share/doc/freebsd</filename> during
	the initial system setup.  Documentation may also be installed at
	any later time using packages as described in <xref
	  linkend="doc-ports-install-package"/>.
